# second-grade-number-game

My daughter had this number game with tiles of paper. Each tile had a number 0-10 on it. You laid out five tiles in a row and placed a sixth tile below them.

You then had to either add or subtract numbers from the top five tiles to equal the bottom tile.

I thought it could be a fun exercise to code and gamify a bit by awarding more points for the more tiles you use in your equation.
